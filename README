Installation
============

- make sure you have the dependencies. These include the Boost C++
libraries, SDL, SDL_image and SDL_ttf, OpenGL and tinyxml. You need the
headers in addition to the libraries.
- get the source using git (git clone
git://github.com/anttisalonen/freekick3.git).
- change to the cloned directory.
- to compile, run make.
- to run, use bin/freekick3 (there's no make install yet).

Playing
=======

Use mouse to control the kick direction and keyboard (w/a/s/d) to control
the run direction. See the in-game help for more information.

Teams
=====

Freekick 3 includes some made up teams. If you want to use more realistic
teams, you can use the utility swos2fk (compiled using make) to convert
Sensible World of Soccer teams (PC format) to Freekick 3 teams. Usage:

  $Â mkdir ~/.freekick/share/teams
  $ bin/swos2fk ~/.freekick3/share/teams/ path/to/swos/PC/Data/TEAM.*

This will create the Freekick 3 teams in directory ~/.freekick3/share/teams.
