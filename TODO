Dynamic energy status for teams
 - Initially lower energy status for the away team
 - Changes with time, ball possession, goals
 - e.g.:
  - on first goal, scoring team energy lowered, other team energy raised
  - on connection goal, scoring team energy raised
  - notion of break point, where the goal lowers energy of both teams
 - Add risk taking for losing team, add careful playing for winning team
Consider new team tactics settings, e.g.:
 - Wing attacks
 - Careful playing
Curved shots
 - curve strength and direction depends on the shape of the triangle formed by player, ball position, target position
